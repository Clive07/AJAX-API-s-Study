## Questions

1. What is Ajax? What advantages and disadvantages does it brings?

   ```
   some of the advantages are:
   
   due to it not having to refresh the entire page. It is faster
   
   asychronous calls can be made making it so the client isn't forced to wait for the entire page to load. Again speeding up the user experience.
   
   
   one disadvantage is that it requires javascript and so if it is disabled then it cannot work.
   
   harder to debug if there are issues
   ```

2. Explain the differences between XMLHttpRequest, Fetch and Axios.

   ```
   syntax for how it is written naturally. Also xml has the ability to reveal a progress bar for file uploads.
   xml also has the ability to timeout whilst fetch does not.
   
   axios has backwards compatibility
   
   ```

3. Which of the three has the poorest browser support - XMLHttpRequest (XHR), Fetch and Axios?

   ```
   Fetch has the poorest support due to IE not working with it unless you bypass the issue. Also any other browser behind 2017.
